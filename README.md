# BetoScoreboard
Open source Minecraft plugin that implements a dynamic scoreboard that updates automatically using a scheduler. Made to play in a private server with friends and to teach some of them on how to use this part of the Spigot API.

# Current functionalities
- Display a title (not customizable yet).
- Display player name
- Display player's money (updating each 60s)
- Display online players counter (same period update).

_Note: Scoreboards will be more and more customizable in future versions of this plugin. This is only a snapshot.

# Dependencies
